This is a test file for TEA encryption.
The Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a simple block cipher designed for efficiency in software implementation.
It has a small code size and minimal memory requirements.
This text will be encrypted and then decrypted to demonstrate the functionality of the TEA algorithm.
